            <p>As part of learning to become a Full-Stack developer, I have been tasked with creating a fake buisness
                page. I researched a few ideas, and decided on something fun and pointless. This page uses flex-box in
                its design to position various assets, mainly the photos sections below. It uses flex: wrap for easy
                resizing. These photos are of my real-life friends, but the descriptions aretotally nonsense.</p>

                        <h3>Finbar</h3>
                        <p>More of a 'Daryl' kind of Uncle. Guaranteed to make you laugh and recoil. Consumes biffs
                            until dry, please refill with lattes when empty. Finbar will happily accompany you to; the
                            shops, Tinto or the airport (please note: will not board) Favourite Quote: "Got any biff?"

                        <h3>Charlie</h3>
                        <p>If you're in the market for an Uncle that you actually want, look no further! Charlie is the
                            kind of guy you want around. Fun, kind, fun, you name it, he is it! Happy making presents
                            for his real-life neice, or wallowing in his own filth, Charlie is the Uncle for most normal
                            people. Favourite Quote: "Got any money?"</p>

                        <h3>Alfie</h3>
                        <p>For those of you looking for something a little more mature, look no further! You'll be
                            pleasantly dissapointed with our oldest model. Alfie comes with a non-detachable
                            mobile-phone addition, and simply the biggest heart. Favourite quote: "Reckon I can stay
                            on the sofa when I'm finished here mate?"</p>

                        <h3>Selby</h3>
                        <p>A responsible, well mannered and, many would say, contemporary Uncle; Selby brings a little
                            slice of Bournemouth with him wherever he goes. Never says no to a subtle gaze, Selby has
                            debilitating gout and cannot be served any impure consumables. Favourite quote: "Crickey my
                            gout is playing up guv'ner!</p>
